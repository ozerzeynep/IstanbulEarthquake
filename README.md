This study was carried out in order to predict the amount of loss of life that may occur in the event of a possible earthquake in Istanbul. Within the scope of the study, different machine learning methods and especially the Constrained Extreme Learning Machine (CELM) model were used to predict the loss of life after an earthquake. This model specifies the best performing combinations by testing with a large number of hidden neurons and different activation functions. In the feature selection and data preprocessing steps, techniques such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and PCA (Principal Component Analysis) were used to identify the necessary features and remove the unnecessary ones to increase the success of the model. By scaling and reducing the size of the data set, the model was able to run faster and more accurately. This study aims to present a model that can contribute to the development of strategies to minimise the loss of life in natural disasters such as earthquakes. At the end of the study, detailed performance analyses of the models that obtained the best results were performed and the results were evaluated. The findings and the techniques used in the study provide important information in areas such as natural disaster management and risk analysis.
